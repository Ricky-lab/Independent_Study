## Homework 1
  
## Homework 2
  Homework details:
      ###Reading homework:
          1. Go through the modern CNN: ResNet and Vgg-16. Can explain how they are implemented, and can draw the graph to describe them.
          2. Go through the common used PyTorch.nn (mainly on 2d):
          3. Pooling Layer
          4. Convolution Layer
          5. Normalization Layer
          6. Linear Layer
          7. Loss Func
          8. Optimizer
              Can explain what this layer is used for. Can explain the basic theory of the implementation.
      Coding works:
          1. Implement Vgg-16
               Using <nn.Sequential()>
               Can explain how you design
               Code should be debugged and have a output
          2. Implement RetNet-18
                Using <nn.module>
                Can explain the design, and how they work
                Have a valid output
